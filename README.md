# sql-excel-tableau-project1
Welcome to my data analysis project, where I’m combining SQL, Excel, and Tableau to build an end-to-end analytics workflow. This project is all about learning and improving my skill set as I dive into the world of data, from gathering insights to creating visual stories.

Project Breakdown:
SQL Scripts: I queried multiple tables to pull together essential data on sales orders, customers, products, categories, stores, and sales teams. This step was all about prepping the data and making sure I had everything I needed for deeper analysis.

Excel Analysis: I used Excel to take things further by cleaning, organizing, and calculating key metrics. The goal here was to reveal hidden trends and make sense of the numbers before moving on to visualization.

Tableau Visualizations: Finally, I brought the data to life in Tableau. I created interactive dashboards that make it easy to explore insights and support data-driven decision-making.

As I go through this process, I’m not just completing a project—I’m sharpening my skills and learning new techniques to become a better analyst.
